Fatty15’s co-founder, Dr. Steph Venn-Watson, discovered that C15:0 is not only a good fat, but that C15:0 meets the rare criteria of being the first essential fatty acid to be discovered since omega-3, which was over 90 years ago.<\/p><p>In extensive peer-reviewed studies, C15:0 has been shown to support metabolic, heart, liver and immune health, as well as naturally activate receptors in our bodies that deepen sleep, reduce anxiety, and improve joint comfort.<\/p><p>Essential fatty acids are nutrients that our bodies need to maintain baseline health but can't make. That means we must get these essential fats from our diet or supplements. Today, there are three known essential fatty acids: alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3), linoleic acid (an omega-6), and now, C15:0. Because C15:0 has been shown to have 3x more cellular benefits than omega-3, C15:0 is emerging as the <em>essential<\/em>, essential fatty acid.*<\/p>"

Dairy fat, however, contains much higher levels of pro-inflammatory even-chain saturated fatty acids (C16:0), as well as a wallop of calories. Food-based C15:0 is also tied up in complex lipids called triacylglycerides that make C15:0 less bioavailable.  We developed fatty15 to help consumers get &gt;99.5% pure C15:0 in a vegan-friendly, science-backed and readily bioavailable form.

            "text": "<p>You may be surprised to hear that the most recent studies show that taking omega-3 fish oil supplements does not significantly reduce the risk of developing heart disease, depression or mood disorders, frailty, autoimmune disease, dry eye disease or cognitive decline. This is likely because omega-3 fish oil supplements can be highly variable in omega-3 content and are particularly susceptible to lipid peroxidation, both of which can compromise the quality and effectiveness of omega-3 supplements. <\/p><p>In contrast, fatty15 was developed by doctors to provide a &gt;99.5% pure, science-backed, vegan-friendly, patented and award-winning C15:0 ingredient. Pure C15:0 is an essential fatty acid and a stable powder that is resistant to lipid peroxidation. Each and every batch of fatty15 is tested to guarantee its purity, helping to ensure that you are getting only the good, essential fat that you need. Further, fatty15 has been shown to have 3x more cellular benefits than even the purest, highest performing omega-3.<\/p><p>Given the above, most people can consider fatty15 as a replacement for their omega-3 supplements to support their general, long-term health. If you are taking omega-3s under the supervision of a physician, however, we recommend that you talk with your doctor before making any changes.<\/p><p>Learn more about <a href=\"https:\/\/fatty15.com\/blogs\/news\/we-can-be-better-the-why-behind-fatty15-s-latest-ad-campaign?_pos=1&_psq=why%20campaign&_ss=e&_v=1.0\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">fatty15 vs. omega-3s<\/span><\/a>.<\/p>"
